    "SNS and SQS are notification and queueing systems from AWS, but what's the difference?",

export default (props) => <ArticleLayout meta={meta} {...props} />

[Simple Notification System (SNS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sns) and
[Simple Queuing System (SQS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs) are services from AWS
that provide notifications and queueing, respectively. Now, I've used both SNS
and SQS several times throughout my career, and each time, I need to
google the difference between the two. There is enough time between I stop
using these services and when I start using them again that I ask myself,
"which one is which, again?".

To (hopefully) prevent me from googling this again, I thought I'd write it
down and provide some examples of what SQS and SNS are and how they differ
from one another.

### What is SQS?

SQS is a **queueing** service. And when I say **queueing**, I mean
**queueing**; a list of messages processed (usually) in a first in,
first out order. Processes that want to do _stuff_ with those messages poll the
queue on their schedule. A simple JS example of this would look like this:

```js
let queue = [
  'first in, first out',
  'last in, last out'
]

async function handleMessage(message) {
  // do something with the message
  // create a user, delete a user, update permissions
  return
}

async function poll(queue, callback) {
  if (queue.length <= 0) {
    return []
  }

  const [firstMessage, ...messages] = queue
  await callback(firstMessage)
  return messages
}


let id = setInterval(async () => {
  console.log('processing the queue')
  queue = await poll(queue, handleMessage)
  console.log('queue length: ', queue.length)

  if (queue.length === 0) {
    // stop interval when queue is empty
    clearInterval(id)
    console.log('Done processing')
    process.exit(0)
  }
}, 1000) // 1 second
```

With queues, it's the process's responsibility to poll the queue. The queue won't
inform any interested parties that there is a new message in the queue. Further,
once a message has been taken from the queue, it's no longer available for
other processes. Queues are suitable for work you only want to be done once, such as
sending a new user email, creating a user, or scrubbing PII.
Queues are also a great mechanism to use when communicating between
services. They take asynchronous processes and make them (somewhat) synchronous.
Queues also don't require that the things processing the messages be online.
If a process is down, that's ok. The message will be there when it comes back
online and polls. With SQS, specifically, messages are stored
anywhere between 1 minute to 14 days.

### What is SNS?

SNS is a **notification** service. A helpful mental model is to think of this as
the push notifications you receive on your phone. With push notifications, you
don't open your phone and ask it to check for push notifications; they just
show up.

Picking up your phone and asking if it has any notifications would be the
same as polling a queue. However, with SNS, it notifies you. Additionally,
it notifies _all_ subscribers of the message. This implementation differs from our queue example,
where only one process would get the message before it was removed from the queue.
An example implementation of this would look like this:

```js
function register(arrOrApi, callback) {
  const api = {
    queue: arrOrApi.queue || arrOrApi,
    push: (message) => api.subscribers
      .forEach((subscriber) => subscriber(message)),
    subscribers: [...(arrOrApi.subscribers || []), callback]
  }

  return api
}

let notifications = register(
  [],
  (message) => console.log('first: ', message)
)
notifications = register(
  notifications,
  (message) => console.log('second: ', message)
)

notifications.push('this is a message')
notifications.push('and so is this')
```

In this example, the processes don't need to poll for messages; they're notified.
This means that the process must be online when the message comes through
the notification system and once it runs through the notification system,
it's gone.

### Summary

SNS is a notification system that notifies subscribers. It's good for processing
the same notification in multiple ways, such as processing an image, sending an email
and creating a thumbnail in parallel.

SQS is a queueing system that serves as a list of work to be done by polling processes.
Queues, or SQS, is good for when you have a lot of the same thing all the time. Such as
creating users, updating permissions, or processing a large number of images as they come in.
